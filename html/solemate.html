                        Solemate solves the unmet clinical need of hospital readmission and rehabilitation through a
                        smart shoe insole and software system. Solemate manufactures a low-profile, low-power shoe
                        insole equipped with strategically placed force resistive sensors. For the first time, patients
                        will be able to track their progress day by day, and in turn, physicians will be able to better
                        personalize treatment.
                        <br><br>
                        In the Spring of 2019 a colleague asked if I was interested in temporarily helping his start up,
                        Solemate. The core issue was that their designer specialized in graphic design, and they quickly
                        found through user tests that their app design was flawed. In the next three months I worked
                        alongside a team of developers and their designer to improve their app.

                        <p class="content">Patients with a lower extremity injury spend most of their rehabilitation at
                            home rather than at the clinic. Typically the doctor will recommend putting X amount of
                            pressure on the injured foot, but it is extremely difficult for patients to accurately gauge
                            how much pressure they are putting on their foot. This most likely leads to re-injury as
                            clinics provide little feedback for patients after the initial visit.

                        <p class="content">The solution comes in two parts: A mobile app and a smart shoe insole. The
                            mobile app is meant to provide a way for patients to test their foot pressure and see just
                            how much weight they are putting on a foot in real time. The app then summarizes the data
                            and provides patients with an easy to digest chart tracking their progress. Doctors are then
                            able to provide advice based off of these results.

                            I worked closely with Mona Luo, their graphic designer, to discuss her design process for

                            that Solemate needed hi-fi prototypes for their pitch slides so these screens were whipped
                            up without much research, mostly on what the founders felt was appropriate and Mona’s own
                            intuition.

                            The colors were a bit harsh on some pages and didn’t have much reasoning for why those specific colors were chosen. Visual hierarchy and focus states can be improved as well as updating the overall aesthetic to feel more friendly rather than a cold, medical app.
                            <br><br><br>
                            <span class="bold-content">User Flows<br><br></span>
                            A lot of the user flow felt redundant, such as on boarding that happens each time someone tries to start a test. A lot of the on boarding pages are also irrelevant such as ‘Make sure you’re connected to bluetooth’ which could be an error caught before even starting the test.

                                Rehabilitation can take months and this is mostly because each 'session' will last around four to six weeks where each 
                                session will ask for a different target weight. These target weights are usually standardardized so users should be able
                                to do this.

                                <span class="bold-content">Data should be simple to understand and easy to access.<br><br></span>
                                The only information both doctors and patients need to know is how well the patient has been applying the target weight.
                                Users need to be presented this information so that they can easily understand it and it should most likely be 
                                on the home page.

                                We found that therapists are much more interested in having this sort of technology than patients would be. Kristine and Surabhi 
                                already anticipated this which is why app use would be like a prescription from their doctors. That being said, having a well 
                                designed app is still important for user satisfaction.

                        <p class="content">This was one of the first projects that I was taking lead on in terms of design so the overall experience was very educational. I think working with Mona was a fantastic experience because we were constantly teaching each other new things. I was more design process focused, while Mona was able to teach me some things about graphic design and illustration. I think having to work with not only the team, but also coordinating with healthcare professionals made the process a lot more serious and the work that we were doing seemed to have immediate effects on people.
                            <br><br>
                                I think working with such a capable team has enforced a greater appreciation for open dialogue during any stage of the design process. Although the founders of Solemate were very set on what they wanted, it was better that I could bring in more design principles to inform our decisions. As a designer we must be careful listeners, but also an active expresser.
