                    <p class="content">Exalton is a file management platform that is leveraging emerging technologies to bring in a new wave of collaboration. Since each organization tends to work isolated in their own world, we found that innovation begins bottlenecking at trust. Now, imagine a world where anyone, anywhere, can collaborate with each other without the risk of piracy or theft. This is the world Exalton means to create.
                            <br><br>
                            In the Spring of 2019 I had the pleasure of joining Exalton as their core designer. Although they had a solid foundation, and the research to back it up, I was tasked with turning their ideas into a reality. My priority was in their Desktop App, which was the main way we believed users would be interacting with this product. </p>

                        <p class="content">
                            When I first joined Exalton, they already had a solid idea of what they wanted their product
                            to be, and heavy customer
                            interviews to back it up. After catching myself up to speed by reading through interview
                            notes I decided it would be
                            helpful to interview officers in various on-campus organizations to solidify their results.

                        <p class="content">
                            I worked closely with Erik Hanzlick (CEO) and Vidit Goyal (Business Developer) in conducting
                            our competitive analysis.
                            With the guidance of our advisors, we thoroughly dove into searching for companies beyond
                            the mainstream ones such as
                            the aforementioned and Box.</p>

                        <h3 class="section">Key Findings</h3>
                        <p class="content">Based off our results, many people who use file-management platforms such as
                            Dropbox or Google Drive
                            expressed similar issues such as clunky workflows or poor organization of the site
                            itself.<br><br>
                            Across the board we saw that many companies and organizations refused to collaborate with
                            outside entities
                            due to security concerns.

                            <br><br><br>
                            <span class="bold-content">Users value a clean and easily organized workspace.</span>
                            <br><br>
                            A big complaint was just how disorganized some file managers can be. This is especially the
                            case for
                            power users who see numerous files come and go on a daily basis.<br><br><br>

                            <span class="italic-content">"We use our own file manager, but over the course of a project
                                things get pretty messy. We've looked at various options
                                but creating our own folders and sub folders is the only thing that works for
                                us."<br><br></span>

                            <br><br>
                            We also saw that most organizations actually want to collaborate, but there simply isn't a
                            reliable platform to
                            do this with. Most PM's would not feel comfortable sending valuable files to another
                            organization without a
                            guarantee that those files would remain as their own IP.

                            <span class="italic-content">"We've thought about partnering up with other firms, but there
                                really is nothing stopping them from just
                                stealing our product—unless we go through the trouble of filling out the paperwork. But
                                honestly that would be way too annoying and slow."</span>

                            in understanding and defining
                            the problem. Although they had a general idea of what the product should be, I thought it'd
                            be
                            best to lead the team through a few

                            strong product. However, a lack of trust and a failure for programs to mirror real-world
                            projects and teams create a bottleneck. This leads to a less collaborative environment and
                            clunky workflow.</p>

                            Exalton’s end-to-end file sharing platform ensures that no matter who you send a file to,
                            they are only able to do what you allow them to do. File traceability, immutability, and
                            smart contracts strengthens the trust by automating it so cross-organization collaboration
                            is encouraged.

                            <p class="content">Once everyone was onboard with wireframes I started scheduling tests. In order to get the most useful data we knew that we couldn't only test our app on everyday users (such as students), but rather people who have worked in a professional setting with things like a project lead, teams, and sensitive files. Luckily, Vidit worked on an on campus lab which perfectly fit our conditions.
                                <br><br>
                                One core issue I found was with our information scent. Users had trouble accomplishing certain tasks because of this such as creating a new project or joining a team.<br><br>
                                I decided to do a deeper analysis on the mainstream file managers such as Google Drive and One Drive. Since they were so common, having a similar layout to them may make navigating our own application easier. I did the same for Slack and Discord since we were implementing a channel/workspace layout.

                            <p class="image-footer footer-width">More intuitive labels were also added, namely on our ‘Approvals’ page since this was one of the most differentiating aspects of our app compared to other file managers. ‘Approvals’ and ‘To Approve’ were altered to ‘All Files’ and ‘Pending’ respectively. </p>

                            <p class="content">Afterwards, I converted the wireframes into a hi-fi prototype. I ran a heuristic evaluation with Nielsen's Usability Heuristics to see if there were any basic mistakes that slipped through. Once I felt satisfied, I scheduled another round of user testing with the same five lab researchers as well as two new ones. I felt that having some fresh eyes would resolve some testing bias.<br><br>
                            Although the results were much better this time, I still ran into a few issues.<br><br>
                            The first issue was in 'Teams'.  I decided to run A/B tests on having the teams fill up a larger space on the side nav, versus a shorter panel. Some users did not know that this area was scrollable, and ended up not being able to find the specific team they were looking for.</p>

                            <p class="image-footer footer-width top-gap-footer wow fadeInUp">With added visual design, users were much more able to understand that the area was scrollable. Version A actually turned up new problems as having sections of the nav completely disappear brought on a lot more confusion. In the end I decided to go with B, but with a gradient at the bottom to further show users that more lies below.</p>

                            <p class="content">I ran another set of A/B tests for our ‘Projects’ panel. Both Slack and Discord (who use workspaces) have all workspaces always present, and multiple users did not know that projects could even expand into a new panel in our wireframe tests. </p>

I think with this project it taught me a lot about keeping things simple. With apps such as Google Drive that are used by so many people, it’s better to have a recognizable design. Whatever ‘X factor’ that makes your app special should shine behind the scenes. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel.

                    <span class="bold-content">One Step at a Time<br><br></span>Exalton is definitely the most expansive project I have ever taken on, especially being the only designer on the team. At first the vast number of components that had to be designed was daunting, but I learned that breaking components down to smaller parts and taking them on one step at a time greatly reduced my stress and improved my productivity.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <span class="bold-content">Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize!<br><br></span>On top of taking things one step at a time, making sure that you have a plan as to what to work on first is crucial. Having deadlines I set for myself on certain pages or components was crucial in delivering designs on top. This was especially useful because I would face last minute requests for other assets such as a pitch deck or business card which could’ve derailed my whole timeline otherwise.
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    Overall, I want to thank the rest of the team on Exalton for inviting me in, and for giving me the opportunity to work with such passionate individuals. I definitely feel that I learned a lot within those three months and I’m very excited to continue Exalton’s growth.
