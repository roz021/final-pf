                                <span class="bold-content">Context</span><br><br>
                                Once we had an initial prototype for our desktop app, I was tasked with redesigning their 
                                website into something the founders felt comfortable displaying to investors and at conventions. 
                                Since both founders were off on summer internships we gave ourselves most of the summer to craft 
                                our website.
                                <br><br><br>
                                <span class="bold-content">Problem</span><br><br>
                                Once I completed the initial designs for our POC, I was tasked with designing a company website 
                                for Exalton. Up until this point, they only had a minimal website detailing a bit about the company 
                                and who the CEO and CTO were. Now that we almost had a POC completed, we also needed a website that
                                 we could use to build an online presence and market our product.
                                <br><br><br>
                                <span class="bold-content">Solution</span><br><br>
                                I spent the next two months researching and designing the Exalton website. By expanding further on the
                                 brand the Exalton website also became a huge milestone in understanding the look and feel of Exalton
                                  as a whole. By using custom, isometric illustrations and an overall modern aesthetic, we hoped to
                                 show that we can compete with other well-known companies.

                                <p class="content">The first step I took before designing a single page was to do some research on web design, specifically for business purposes, and from there, how to make the website stand out among the sea of other start ups. I then followed this up with some user research.  I planned a couple interviews with a few of my colleagues at UCSD. The main goal for me was to understand how users navigate a company’s website as well as what they are looking for, especially with start ups that don’t have a reputation yet. On top of this, I began browsing other company websites to get a feel for the trends especially with other start ups.</p>

                                As with any other company, their website is crucial for their brand and identity. It is most likely what their potential customers will see first so information has to be presented in a clear and logical way. The site also needs to look nice and have something that is constantly keeping the user’s attention.
                                <br><br><br><span class="bold-content">Consolidate all useful information in one place.</span><br><br>
                                There’s always a lot of explaining that happens when people are interested in a new company, especially if they use technology that is beyond the common scope. This means that all relevant information that any potential customer way want should be provided, and if not, an easy way to contact us should be available.
                                <br><br><br>
                                <span class="bold-content">Continue building the brand.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                As mentioned before, the website is crucial for a company’s brand. Therefore, the website should encapsulate the company’s energy be it in visual design, interaction design, or content.
                                <br><br><br>
                                <span class="bold-content">Increase Business</span>
                                <br><br>
                                The site should be like a flagship store for the company. User’s should be able to sign up for an account or a newsletter to be updated on company developments. Having some sort of connection through a newsletter would increase customer retention, or in our case, customer conversion.

The landing page would capture a bit of everything while also providing links to enter into every other page. This was so that the information presented was very fluid, almost like a narrative. We knew that most people prefer scanning over reading, so information was also presented in a way that promotes that without losing core details.</p>

                                        I decided to pursue a mobile first design ideology so I created the mobile wireframes first. We 
                                        ran into some issues with creating the copy for our site because our CEO and CTO couldn’t gauge
                                         how much to write through the mobile screens so I decided to create very rough web wireframe 
                                         with additional labels to help them with those.

                                        After the conference I had time to revise the site. Since I already had the live site 
                                        I began testing with that. We ran into two big issues with our site: <span class="bold-reg">content and layout.</span>
                                         On both the landing and product page our copy was not as user friendly as we had thought.
                                          Too much technical jargon littered the feature highlights on the product page, and text 
                                          within the landing page which is supposed to be a very friendly and light introduction 
                                          to our product was confusing and again, <span class="bold-reg">too techincal to understand.</span><br><br>

                                          The other big problem was with layout, specifically on the home page.<span class="bold-reg"> Things

                                           issue that I should’ve caught through user testing on mobile screens. Based 
                                           off of this I went back and did just that, testing heavily on mobile versions
                                            of the site to guide my decisions on the web version.

                                        Since I didn’t have all that much experience in graphic design, coming up with and creating 
                                        our custom illustrations was a big mountain to climb. I had to use a lot of references on 
                                        sites such as Dribbble, Pinterest, and even Google Images. Being able to have inspirations
                                         to build off of and make into my own helped a lot in the process and I definitely learned 
                                         a ton about using images off of the internet as inspirations rather than a stencil. 
                                        <br><br><br>
                
                                        <span class="bold-content">Teamwork Makes the Dream Work<br><br></span>
                                        Going through the design process validated my belief that teamwork is key, even if other 
                                        team members aren’t in a design-centric major. Coming up with the visuals and layout for 
                                        the site was a culmination of all of our opinions and as we kept having meetings and iterating 
                                        through the design I was able to finalize something all of us enjoyed.
                                        <br><br><br><br>
                                        <span class="bold-content">Next Steps<br><br></span>
                                        Although our team is happy with the website design, I personally still think there is 
                                        more room to grow. I wanted to veer away from the “Silicon Valley/Start Up” aesthetic 
                                        with pastel colors and minimal artwork or photography. After browsing through dozens 
                                        of websites for inspiration I noticed that a lot of them looked very similar to each 
                                        other (pastel colors, minimal photographic direction, and those abstract humanoid figures). 
                                        The ones that stood out to me are those with very well put together videos, 3D renderings, 
                                        and interactive backgrounds. I hope in the coming months to grow my skills as a designer t
                                        o learn how to do more with new tools so I can add more unique elements to Exalton’s brand.
