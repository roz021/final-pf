                            <p class="content">Exalton is a file management platform that is leveraging emerging technologies to bring in a new wave of collaboration. Since each organization tends to work isolated in their own world, we found that innovation begins bottlenecking at trust. Now, imagine a world where anyone, anywhere, can collaborate with each other without the risk of piracy or theft. This is the world Exalton means to create.

                                    Once we had an initial prototype for our desktop app, I was tasked with redesigning their website into something the founders felt comfortable displaying to investors and at conventions. Since both founders were off on summer internships we gave ourselves most of the summer to craft our website.                        </div>

                                <p class="content">The first step I took before designing a single page was to do some research on web design, specifically for business purposes, and from there, how to make the website stand out among the sea of other start ups. I then followed this up with some user research.  I planned a couple interviews with a few of my colleagues at UCSD. The main goal for me was to understand how users navigate a company’s website as well as what they are looking for, especially with start ups that don’t have a reputation yet. On top of this, I began browsing other company websites to get a feel for the trends especially with other start ups.</p>

                                As with any other company, their website is crucial for their brand and identity. It is most likely what their potential customers will see first so information has to be presented in a clear and logical way. The site also needs to look nice and have something that is constantly keeping the user’s attention.
                                <br><br><br><span class="bold-content">Consolidate all useful information in one place.</span><br><br>
                                There’s always a lot of explaining that happens when people are interested in a new company, especially if they use technology that is beyond the common scope. This means that all relevant information that any potential customer way want should be provided, and if not, an easy way to contact us should be available.
                                <br><br><br>
                                <span class="bold-content">Continue building the brand.</span>
                                <br><br>
                                As mentioned before, the website is crucial for a company’s brand. Therefore, the website should encapsulate the company’s energy be it in visual design, interaction design, or content.
                                <br><br><br>
                                <span class="bold-content">Increase Business</span>
                                <br><br>
                                The site should be like a flagship store for the company. User’s should be able to sign up for an account or a newsletter to be updated on company developments. Having some sort of connection through a newsletter would increase customer retention, or in our case, customer conversion.

The landing page would capture a bit of everything while also providing links to enter into every other page. This was so that the information presented was very fluid, almost like a narrative. We knew that most people prefer scanning over reading, so information was also presented in a way that promotes that without losing core details.</p>
