                        Exalton is a file management platform that is leveraging emerging technologies to
                        bring in a new wave of collaboration. Since each organization tends to work isolated in their
                        own world, we found that innovation begins bottlenecking at trust. Now, imagine a world where
                        anyone, anywhere, can collaborate with each other without the risk of piracy or theft. This is
                        the world Exalton means to create.
                        <br><br>
                        In the Spring of 2019 I had the pleasure of joining Exalton as their core designer. Although
                        they had a solid foundation, and the research to back it up, I was tasked with turning their
                        ideas into a reality. My priority was in their Desktop App, which was the main way we believed
                        users would be interacting with this product.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <span class="bold-content">Problem</span><br><br>
                        Todays file managers fall short of being ideal for many businesses who heavily interact with
                         their assets such as research labs or SaaS companies. The problem comes in three-fold: a lack
                          of security of their files, an interface that considers how businesses internally organize their 
                          team, and a lack of automation for tasks that can be seen as ‘busy work’.
                        <br><br><br>
                        <span class="bold-content">Solution</span><br><br>
                        Exalton is built with a keen eye towards designing for organizations. Using a distributed ledger 
                        system to ensure that all files are within full control of the owner both online and offline has 
                        opened the floodgates on collaboration, especially between organizations. Your IP is guaranteed no 
                        matter who has access to your files. An interface inspired by popular file managers and Slack makes 
                        working in teams much more streamlined. The days of a cluttered and unorganized mass of files are no longer.

                            To begin our research I first met with Erik (CEO) and Abinesh (CTO) to go over what 
                            findings they had made with initial customer interviews that gauged interest. We decided
                             that further research was necessary so I began scheduling another round of interviews. I
                              conducted 7 interviews total, 3 were with individuals in the biotech industry and the other
                              4 were officers in campus organizations such as TSE and EECS.

                        <p class="content">Based off our results, many people who use file-management platforms such as
                            Dropbox or Google Drive
                            expressed similar issues such as clunky workflows or poor organization of the site
                            itself. We also found that certain labs on campus have built their own file managers since current ones
                            on the market leave a lot to be desired still.<br><br>
                            Across the board we saw that many companies and organizations refused to collaborate with
                            outside entities
                            due to security concerns.

                            A big complaint was just how disorganized some file managers can be. This is especially the
                            case for
                            power users who see numerous files come and go on a daily basis.<br><br>

                            We also saw that most organizations actually want to collaborate, but there simply isn't a
                            reliable platform to
                            do this with. Most PM's would not feel comfortable sending valuable files to another
                            organization without a
                            guarantee that those files would remain as their own IP.

                            Users don’t want to get bogged down by all the technical aspects of the platform, 
                            especially not blockchain. Make it transparent what problem(s) are being solved without
                             going to deep on how they are being solved. As long as we stay true to our promises, 
                             the UX will also stay, dare I say it, delightful.

                            be
                            best to lead the team through a few
                            design tasks to solidify our objective and better relate with our user. We created an empathy map on
                            a who we believed would use file managers frequently, specifically for work. We then went into Invision Freehand to
                            collaborate on two journey maps.</p>

                            Exalton’s end-to-end file sharing platform ensures that no matter who you send a file to,
                            they are only able to do what you allow them to do. File traceability, immutability, and
                            smart contracts strengthens the trust by automating it so cross-organization collaboration
                            is encouraged.

                        <p class="content">Once everyone was onboard with wireframes I started scheduling tests. In
                            order to get the most useful data we knew that we couldn't only test our app on everyday
                            users (such as students), but rather people who have worked in a professional setting with
                            things like a project lead, teams, and sensitive files. Luckily, Vidit worked on an on
                            campus lab which perfectly fit our conditions.
                            <br><br>
                            One core issue I found was with our information scent. Users had trouble accomplishing
                            certain tasks because of this such as creating a new project or joining a team.<br><br>
                            I decided to do a deeper analysis on the mainstream file managers such as Google Drive and
                            One Drive. Since they were so common, having a similar layout to them may make navigating
                            our own application easier. I did the same for Slack and Discord since we were implementing
                            a channel/workspace layout.

                        <p class="image-footer footer-width">More intuitive labels were also added, namely on our
                            ‘Approvals’ page since this was one of the most differentiating aspects of our app compared
                            to other file managers. ‘Approvals’ and ‘To Approve’ were altered to ‘All Files’ and
                            ‘Pending’ respectively. </p>

                        <p class="content">Afterwards, I converted the wireframes into a hi-fi prototype. I ran a
                            heuristic evaluation with Nielsen's Usability Heuristics to see if there were any basic
                            mistakes that slipped through. Once I felt satisfied, I scheduled another round of user
                            testing with the same five lab researchers as well as two new ones. I felt that having some
                            fresh eyes would resolve some testing bias.<br><br>
                            Although the results were much better this time, I still ran into a few issues.<br><br>
                            The first issue was in 'Teams'. I decided to run A/B tests on having the teams fill up a
                            larger space on the side nav, versus a shorter panel. Some users did not know that this area
                            was scrollable, and ended up not being able to find the specific team they were looking for.

                            new problems as having sections of the nav completely disappear brought on a lot more
                            confusion. In the end I decided to go with B, but with a gradient at the bottom to further
                            show users that more lies below.</p>

                            know that projects could even expand into a new panel in our wireframe tests. </p>

                            going on already, so dedicating so much real estate to navigation could get annoying. On top of that,
                            we saw that files between projects would rarely cross paths and users who are involved with multiple
                        projects tend to remain in one project workspace on a single day.</p>

                        many people, it’s better to have a recognizable design. Whatever ‘X factor’ that makes your app
                        special should shine behind the scenes. There’s no need to reinvent the wheel.

                        <span class="bold-content">One Step at a Time<br><br></span>Exalton is definitely the most
                        expansive project I have ever taken on, especially being the only designer on the team. At first
                        the vast number of components that had to be designed was daunting, but I learned that breaking
                        components down to smaller parts and taking them on one step at a time greatly reduced my stress
                        and improved my productivity.

                        <span class="bold-content">Prioritize, Prioritize, Prioritize!<br><br></span>On top of taking
                        things one step at a time, making sure that you have a plan as to what to work on first is
                        crucial. Having deadlines I set for myself on certain pages or components was crucial in
                        delivering designs on top. This was especially useful because I would face last minute requests
                        for other assets such as a pitch deck or business card which could’ve derailed my whole timeline
                        otherwise.

                        I was really grateful to have this opportunity to join Exalton and begin building their product,
                        and within those three months I definitely felt like I learned a lot. <br>
                        Given that this version of the app is only meant for the POC, there is still a lot more to design,
                        to test, and to iterate on. These designs are nowhere near perfect, but Rome was never built in a day :). 
                        I'm excited to see what more I can learn and how I can apply my skills as a growing designer onto this project.
