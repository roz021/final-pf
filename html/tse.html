                                    This last spring, I was contacted by the president of Triton Software Engineering (TSE) to redesign their organization’s website. I worked heavily with the other board members as well as the president to polish their website.

                                <h3 class="section">Why Redesign?</h3>
                                <p class="content">
                                        My first meeting with Sumeet was focused primarily on why he, and the rest of the organization, felt that their website needed a redesign. The following are the core points:
                                        <br><br><br>
                                        <span class="bold-content">Aesthetic was outdated.<br><br>When their initial site launched they had multiple developer quickly putting it together so a lot of pages are inconsistent.
                                        <br><br>
                                        On top of that, the website content itself is outdated. Since 2017, TSE has grown tremendously and actually have worked on projects which should be showcased.
                                        <br><br>
                                        They knew who their audience was (students/non-profits), and felt that the website wasn't curated for them.
                                        <br><br>
                                        Overall design felt bleak and distant. TSE's mission is for social good and community building, and Sumeet wanted the site to express that.

He emphasized that their layout was basically what he wanted, but was open to what I could come up with.
                                        <br><br>
                                        I did a lot of research on their navigation, the colors they chose to use, and the overall tone of their website. I also looked at other non-profit organizations and how their websites were formatted.</p>

                                    I went ahead and interviewed multiple members on the board, including Sumeet, to holistically understand what they imagine the goals for the website redesign to be. These would then further guide my design process and also solidify the metrics that TSE wants to improve upon.
                                <br><br>
                                <span class="bold-content">Usability<br><br></span>
                                Improve the browsing experience so that users can easily navigate through the page and find what information they are looking for efficiently.

                                <span class="bold-content">Conversion<br><br></span>
                                By enhancing the overall design and implementing features that competing organizations have on their website TSE hopes to increase the amount of people who are interested in applying for both students and non-profits.

                                <span class="bold-content">Brand<br><br></span>
                                Completely refresh the visual brand for their website which would hopefully attract more visitors. Having a more consistent style guide will also build on TSE’s personality and pave the way for other branding materials (flyers, event pages, business cards, etc.).

                                        Oftentimes we obsess about simplifying things, and that by keeping it simple, it becomes easier for users to complete a task. However, TSE’s website was too simple. They had so few sections that it was impossible to accomplish things like building a brand or showcasing their work. All of these aspects are critical for TSE’s success as they can act as reasons for people to prefer TSE over another organization.

                                       <p class="content">The main issue that remained was that users still had questions about TSE, and there wasn’t a reliable way for them to answer these questions (besides contacting TSE).
                                            <br><br>
                                            I decided that we needed a FaQ section, and ran A/B tests on whether it should be on the home page or on the connect page since those seemed to be where the original users had the most questions.</p>

                                       <p class="content">I completely redid TSE’s original style, although there wasn’t much of a consistent style to begin with.
                                            I decided to incorporate a more minimal and fluid design while also adding a lot more personalized headers and photos.
                                             I wanted the website to act more than just a website to fill out applications in, but an embodiment of TSE, who they 
                                             are, and what they are about.

                                            <p class="content">Although we did do some testing, I would like to have tested on actual users rather than random students. Ideally I would be able to test the website from this year’s fall recruitment where there are actual students who are interested in TSE. I would also like to test the website further with non-profit stakeholders which would allow me to fine tune the website even further.
                                                <br><br>
                                                    Overall I’m very happy with how the redesign went. The rest of TSE also feels the same which is a great relief for myself. Currently I’m working on a redesign for their logo as well which will be coming soon!
